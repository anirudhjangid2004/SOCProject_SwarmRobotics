# SOCProject_SwarmRobotics
Repo to upload the SOC project details.
The project is quite interesting and I am able to learn at the level as expected initially. Also the mentors are quite supportive and helping in nature.
Till now I learnt some basic programming in python and then I started learning ROS via its tutorials. I have almost completed the tutorials and I liked the content.
Now I started working on tasks given by our mentor.
